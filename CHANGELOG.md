## [v1.0.1] – 2026-02-01

### 🐛 Fixed
- Fixed a mobile-only sidebar issue where the collections header, create input, and action buttons could disappear after sending a request and auto-scrolling to the response.
- Improved sidebar layout stability on mobile devices by isolating scroll behavior to the collections list.

### 🧠 Notes
- Desktop behavior remains unchanged.
- No API, backend, or request execution logic was affected.
